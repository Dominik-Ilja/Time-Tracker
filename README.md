# Time Tracker

## Description

Time Tracker is an application that allows you to track and visualize how much time you've spent. You create categories and then select a category to put time into. You run the timer and hit complete when you don't want to track time anymore. Your time is then updated with the appropriate category. Your total time for each category is then displayed on the homepage. You can add or delete entries simply by clicking into a category. This page will allow you to create, update, or delete entries.

## Challenges
I expect creating a timer might pose a challenge. More specifically, tracking the time properly once the timer is paused. Also, authentication and seperating the data for different users.

## MVP
- Captures time from timer
- Ability to create categories
- Displays accumulated times
- CRUD actions for updating category items

## POST MVP
- Dark mode
- Export logs
- Select specific time periods
- Display data in charts
- Garden grows on how much time is added
- Mobile & Tablet Responsive design
- User creation
- User autherization
